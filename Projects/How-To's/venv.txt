python -m venv env_name
"with python (may need to use python3 if mult python installed), use module venv, name it env_name"

then use the new environment as the interpreter

to activate the new environment to be used with the terminal, go to command pallete and type (python create terminal)

On github there is an ubuntuEnv and my_environment (for windows)

You can use the ubuntuEnv on Pycharm or vscode.
    Settings have to do with the interpreter, and using an existing env from the python file in the venv
    You know you have it right when the terminal shows the venv your using.
